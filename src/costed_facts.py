"""
costed_facts.py — the single post-costing answer to "what did we actually price?"

Every customer- and estimator-facing deliverable has to describe the SAME job. They were
each deriving that independently:

  client_quote_html._collect_operations   costed ops
  client_quote_html._finish_line          costed ops OR powder_coating_summary
  job_report_html   powder bullet         powder_coating_summary.by_part
  job_decision_report._ops_explanation    raw textual + inferred op lists

Four derivations of one fact drift apart, and they drift in the direction that hurts: a
quote promising powder coating and weld dressing on a lacquered timber crate the Estimate
sheet charges neither for. The drawing's own routing text cannot be the source, because
these packs carry a range-wide specification legend ("POWDER COATED STEEL", "WELD
SPECIFICATION") that applies to the customer's whole product family, not to this job.

The rule this module encodes: **if an operation carries no cost on this job, it did not
happen.** The workbook is the authority on the price; the costed operations behind it are
the authority on the description. Nothing here reads drawing text.

Reads `estimate_summary.part_estimates` — i.e. only ever AFTER costing.
