"""
costed_facts.py — the single post-costing answer to "what did we actually price?"

Every customer- and estimator-facing deliverable has to describe the SAME job. They were
each deriving that independently:

  client_quote_html._collect_operations   costed ops
  client_quote_html._finish_line          costed ops OR powder_coating_summary
  job_report_html   powder bullet         powder_coating_summary.by_part
  job_decision_report._ops_explanation    raw textual + inferred op lists

Four derivations of one fact drift apart, and they drift in the direction that hurts: a
quote promising powder coating and weld dressing on a lacquered timber crate the Estimate
sheet charges neither for. The drawing's own routing text cannot be the source, because
these packs carry a range-wide specification legend ("POWDER COATED STEEL", "WELD
SPECIFICATION") that applies to the customer's whole product family, not to this job.

The rule this module encodes: **if an operation carries no cost on this job, it did not
happen.** Nothing here reads drawing text.

SOURCE ORDER, and the distinction matters:

  1. `workbook_labour.rows`  — CANONICAL. The labour rows wb_populate actually accepted,
     after its spurious-op, finish and material filters, after department mapping, and
     including injected operations. This is the route the Estimate sheet charges.
  2. `estimate_summary.part_estimates[].labour_estimate.costs_gbp` — FALLBACK ONLY, for a
     summary with no workbook built. It is PRE-FILTER: it still carries powder on timber
     panels and weld/dress on artefact records the workbook drops, so anything described
     from it can name operations the sheet does not contain.

The workbook is the authority on the price (wep-readback stamps its totals back); it is
equally the authority on the route, which is why (1) exists.
